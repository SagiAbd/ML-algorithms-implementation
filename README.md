# ML-algorithms-implementation

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of popular machine learning algorithms. The goal is to help learners understand the underlying concepts and mathematics behind each algorithm.

## Algorithms implemented

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Multiple Linear Regression
   - Metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, R2)
   - Regularization (L1, L2, ElasticNet)
   - Stochastic Gradient Descent
